## Key Components

1. **Authentication System**
   - Login (`/auth/login`)
   - Signup (`/auth/signup`)

2. **Product Management**
   - Product listings (`/products`)
   - Product data simulated in `src/lib/products.ts`

3. **Shopping Cart**
   - Cart context in `src/context/cart-context.tsx`
   - Cart page (`/cart`)

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Dashboard with metrics (`/admin/dashboard`)
   - Order history and stock management

## Data Management

This demo uses static data for products, orders, and stock levels. In a production environment, this would be replaced with database queries and API endpoints.


## Authentication & Role-Based Access

- Login now issues a signed, **HTTP-only session cookie** (`session_token`).
- Middleware protects `/admin/*` routes and redirects unauthorized users to `/auth/login`.
- Admin-only API operations are enforced server-side for:
  - `/api/admin/assign-role`
  - product create/update/delete on `/api/products`
  - order management routes (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) on `/api/orders`

Set this environment variable in production:

```bash
SESSION_SECRET=your-long-random-secret
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run start` - Runs the built app in production mode
- `npm run lint` - Runs the linter
